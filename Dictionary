Dictionary is just like map in c++ 
key-value pairs are present
number,char,string all combinations can be used

shop={
    "sting":20,
    "coke":"N/A",
    "red bull":100,
    "monster":95,
    "prime":400
}

shop["corona"]=300

print(shop["sting"])
print(shop["red bull"])
print(shop["monster"])


# like c++ we can declare map in the same way we declare in it also we can use the above technique as well 
# also we can make our new key value pair using get

print(shop.get("sting"))
# used get to print value

print(shop.get("pepsi",20))
# used to declare new key value pair
print(shop["corona"])

shop2={}
# simple declaration in which we havent declared anything else
shop2["beer"]=300

print(shop2["beer"])
